            <h1>Amazing Continent</h1>
            <small>Africa</small>
            <p>
                Africa is the world's second-largest and 
                second-most populous continent, after Asia 
                in both cases.Despite this low concentration of wealth,
                recent economic expansion and the large and young population 
                make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.

                The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, 
                the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean 
                to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. 
                The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. 
                It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), 
                eight territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.
                Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population.
                African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, 
                which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.

            <p>
                The two African rhino species – black rhino and white rhino – 
                have both increased in number in recent years thanks 
                to successful conservation efforts, especially in South Africa.
                Indeed, the white rhino has been brought back from the brink of extinction.
                
                However, both species are again at risk due to a huge surge in poaching
                to meet demand for illegal rhino horn, primarily in Asia. 
                Countries and conservationists are stepping up their efforts
                but record numbers of rhinos are currently being killed.
